# CTDPathSim
R package CTDPathSim is a computational pipeline to compute similarity scores between patient samples and cell lines using a pathway activity-based approach. CTDPathSim integrates sample-specific expression and methylation profiles utilizing a deconvolution method. CTDPathSim has four main computational steps.

 Step 1. Computing sample-specific deconvoluted methylation profile
 
 Step 2. Computing sample-specific deconvoluted expression profile
 
 Step 3. Computing sample and cell line-specific biological pathways
 
 Step 4. Computing sample-cell line pathway activity-based similarity score
