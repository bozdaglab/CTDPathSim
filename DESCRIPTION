Description: CTDPathSim is a computational pipeline to compute similarity scores between patient samples and cell lines 
             using a pathway activity-based approach. CTDPathSim integrates sample-specific expression and methylation 
             profiles utilizing a deconvolution method. CTDPathSim has four main computational steps.
             Step 1. Computing sample-specific deconvoluted methylation profile.
             Step 2. Computing sample-specific deconvoluted expression profile.
             Step 3. Computing sample and cell line-specific biological pathways.
             Step 4. Computing sample-cell line pathway activity-based similarity score.
